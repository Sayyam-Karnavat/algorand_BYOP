Title: Closed-form expressions for the centroid-tilt error due to scintillation
Abstract: In adaptive optics, the tracker and wavefront sensor commonly measure
irradiance centroids (in their respective focal planes) to estimate the
turbulence-degraded wavefront in the pupil plane. Several factors affect the
accuracy of these centroid measurements, including noise, speckle, and
scintillation. The centroid-tilt or ``C-tilt'' errors due to these factors have
been studied by numerous researchers; however, to our knowledge, closed-form
expressions for the C-tilt error due to scintillation have not been found.
  In this paper, we derive such expressions, assuming spherical-wave
illumination of the pupil, a path-invariant index of refraction structure
constant $C_n^2$, and Kolmogorov turbulence. We compare the analytically
predicted C-tilt values to those obtained by wave-optics simulations. The
agreement, at large, is quite good over a wide range of conditions. As a
result, researchers and engineers will find this analysis useful when
quantifying the performance of centroid-based trackers and wavefront sensors,
both of which are critical adaptive-optics components.

In adaptive optics, the tracker and wavefront sensor commonly measure irradiance centroids (in
their respective focal planes) to estimate the turbulence-degraded wavefront in the pupil plane.
Several factors aﬀect the accuracy of these centroid measurements, including noise, speckle, and
scintillation.
The centroid-tilt or “C-tilt” errors due to these factors have been studied by nu-
merous researchers; however, to our knowledge, closed-form expressions for the C-tilt error due to
scintillation have not been found.
In this paper, we derive such expressions, assuming spherical-wave illumination of the pupil, a
path-invariant index of refraction structure constant C2
n, and Kolmogorov turbulence. We compare
the analytically predicted C-tilt values to those obtained by wave-optics simulations. The agreement,
at large, is quite good over a wide range of conditions. As a result, researchers and engineers will
ﬁnd this analysis useful when quantifying the performance of centroid-based trackers and wavefront
sensors, both of which are critical adaptive-optics components.

INTRODUCTION
It is common knowledge that as light propagates
through atmospheric turbulence it accumulates phase er-
rors distributed along the path [1–7].
Adaptive-optics
systems often employ tilt and higher-order wavefront sen-
sors (in the form of trackers and Shack–Hartmann wave-
front sensors) to estimate these path-integrated phase er-
rors [8–13]. Both sensors generally operate on the same
principle: They measure the centroid of an irradiance
pattern in a focal plane to estimate the light’s phase func-
tion in the pupil plane. For the tracker, the centroid mea-
surement is global and provides an estimate of the aver-
age phase gradient over the pupil. The Shack–Hartmann
wavefront sensor, on the other hand, partitions the pupil
into subapertures and therefore, provides estimates of the
average phase gradients over the subaperture areas. In
the absence of noise, speckle, and scintillation, both of
these sensors measure what is known as gradient tilt or
“G-tilt” [7, 14].
Unfortunately, there are two problems with using G-
tilt to estimate the path-integrated phase errors.
For
simplicity, we focus the discussion on the tilt sen-
sor or tracker.
The actual or true amount of tilt
in the turbulence-degraded wavefront is given by the
weights/coeﬃcients of the tip/tilt Zernike polynomials
Z±1
1
[7, 15–17]. Although G-tilt clearly includes Zernike
tilt or “Z-tilt,” it also includes contributions from all
other oﬀ-axis aberrations (predominately coma) that pro-
duce shifted or sheered point spread functions [7, 18].
∗mhyde@epsilonsystems.com
This Z-tilt, G-tilt error, known as centroid anisopla-
natism, has been studied and quantiﬁed by many re-
searchers, including Sasiela [7], Tyler [14], and Yura and
Tavis [19].
The second issue with using G-tilt to estimate the
path-integrated phase errors (tilt, in particular) concerns
the measurement of the irradiance centroid. Multiple fac-
tors aﬀect the accuracy of this measurement, including
noise, speckle, and atmospheric amplitude ﬂuctuations
(better known as scintillation). When considering these
real-world eﬀects, it is common to distinguish this tilt,
called centroid tilt or “C-tilt,” from pure G-tilt.
The error due to C-tilt has also been studied by nu-
merous researchers: Tyler and Fried quantiﬁed the C-
tilt error due to sensor noise [20]; Burrell et al. devel-
oped scaling laws for the C-tilt error considering target-
induced speckle [21]; and lastly, Tavis and Yura [22],
Holmes [23], Shaw and Tomlinson [24], and Mitchell et
al. [25, 26] studied the eﬀects of amplitude variation on
C-tilt. These latter studies were either numerical in na-
ture (i.e., used quadrature to evaluate integral expres-
sions or wave-optics simulations to quantify C-tilt) or
did not consider turbulence-induced scintillation as a po-
tential source of amplitude variation.
In this paper, we derive closed-form expressions that
quantify the C-tilt error of a scintillated spherical wave
(see Section II). To validate these expressions, we employ
wave-optics simulations, which we describe in Section III.
We then compare the simulation results to predictions
from our analytical expressions in Section IV. The agree-
ment, at large, is excellent over a broad range of condi-
tions. Lastly, we conclude with a brief summary of our
work.

THEORY
In this section, we start with Tatarskii’s deﬁnition of
the C-tilt angle [1, 27] and utilize Mellin transform tech-
niques [7, 28] to obtain three closed-form expressions for
the C-tilt variance, as well as the G-tilt, C-tilt error.
These expressions, in general, are functions of the Fres-
nel number NF [29, 30]. The ﬁrst, which is valid for all
NF , is in the form of a Meijer G-function [7, 28, 31, 32],
while the second and third are simple, physical relations
accurate for NF ≪1 and NF ≫1, respectively.
A.
Centroid-tilt variance
The angular centroid location in the focal plane is given
by
TC =
ZZ ∞
−∞
(ρ/f) I (ρ) d2ρ
ZZ ∞
−∞
I (ρ) d2ρ
,
(1)
where ρ = ˆxx + ˆyy, f is the focal length, and I is the ir-
radiance in the focal plane. Tatarskii showed that Eq. (1)
is equivalent to [1, 9, 27]
TC = 1
k
ZZ ∞
−∞
circ (ρ/D) ∇φ (ρ) I (ρ) d2ρ
ZZ ∞
−∞
circ (ρ/D) I (ρ) d2ρ
.
(2)
Here, ρ and I are in the pupil plane, k = 2π/λ, D is
diameter of the circular pupil, and ∇φ is the phase gra-
dient.
Consider a spherical wave radiated by a point source
located a distance z away from the pupil. The irradiance
in the pupil plane takes the form
I (ρ) = |U0|2
(λz)2 exp [2χ (ρ)] ,
(3)
where U0 is the amplitude of the point source and χ is
the log-amplitude ﬂuctuations due to atmospheric turbu-
lence [4, 6]. Substituting Eq. (3) into Eq. (2) yields
TC = 1
k
ZZ ∞
−∞
circ (ρ/D) ∇φ (ρ) exp [2χ (ρ)] d2ρ
ZZ ∞
−∞
circ (ρ/D) exp [2χ (ρ)] d2ρ
.
(4)
We are interested in the C-tilt variance (note that the
mean equals zero); therefore,
⟨TC · TC⟩= ⟨T 2
C⟩= 1
k2
*

ZZZZ ∞
−∞
circ (ρ1/D) circ (ρ2/D) exp [2χ (ρ1)] exp [2χ (ρ2)] d2ρ1d2ρ2
+
.
(5)
To proceed, we make the approximation that the mean of the quotient is equal to the quotient of the means, such
that
⟨T 2
C⟩≈1
k2
ZZZZ ∞
−∞
circ (ρ1/D) circ (ρ2/D) B∇φ (|ρ1 −ρ2|) exp [4Bχ (|ρ1 −ρ2|)] d2ρ1d2ρ2
ZZZZ ∞
−∞
circ (ρ1/D) circ (ρ2/D) exp [4Bχ (|ρ1 −ρ2|)] d2ρ1d2ρ2
,
(6)
where B∇φ and Bχ are the phase gradient and log-
amplitude covariance functions [14, 33].
Following
Holmes [23], we also assume that the turbulent phase
gradient and log amplitude are statistically independent.
Making the change of variables ρ′ = ρ1 and ρ = ρ1 −ρ2
and transforming to polar coordinates produces
⟨T 2

is the optical transfer function [29, 30]. Equation (7) is
the primary focus of this paper.
B.
Evaluating Eq. (7)
To proceed further, we make the weak turbulence ap-
proximation exp [4Bχ (ρ)] ≈1 + 4Bχ (ρ), as it is not pos-
3
sible to evaluate the integrals with Bχ in the arguments
of the exponentials. We focus ﬁrst on the numerator.
1.
The numerator
The weak turbulence approximation splits the numer-
ator of Eq. (7) into the sum of two integrals:
⟨T 2
C⟩N ≈2π
k2A
Z ∞
0
ρΛ (ρ/D) B∇φ (ρ) dρ
+ 2π
k2A

ρΛ (ρ/D) B∇φ (ρ) 4Bχ (ρ) dρ.
(9)
We recognize the ﬁrst integral as the G-tilt variance

T 2
G

[7, 14, 27]. For convenience, we refer to the sec-
ond as the G-tilt, C-tilt variance

T 2
GC

.
Starting with

T 2
G

, we can evaluate the integral rather
easily using the spherical-wave version of Tyler’s expres-
sion for B∇φ [14], i.e.,
B∇φ (ρ) = 5

Kolmogorov turbulence and path-independent index of

The integral in Eq. (14) can be evaluated using the Mellin
convolution theorem [7, 28].
To do so, we need the
Mellin transforms of the functions in the integrand, Λ (x)
and 4Bχ (x)—the former we have, the latter we do not.
Therefore, we need to derive the Mellin transform of 4Bχ
to proceed further.

For relative ease of numerical computation, we can
write Eq. (21) in the form of a Meijer G-function [7, 28,
32, 34]. Numerical routines to evaluate such functions
are available in MATLAB, Mathematica, and Python.
Note that there are several diﬀerent deﬁnitions of a Mei-
jer G-function. Here, we use the one given in Ref. [32],
which is consistent with the Meijer G-function routines
in Mathematica and Python, namely,

The integration contour γ in Eq. (22) passes between
the poles arising from the Γ (bj + s) and Γ (1 −aj −s)
gamma functions. In our particular case, γ encloses the
poles at s = −m + 5/12, −m −1/12, and −m −1 for
m = 0, 1, · · · , but excludes the pole at s = 0. In Eq. (21),
the contour C includes this pole. Therefore, to write the
integral in Eq. (21) in terms of a Meijer G-function, we
need to add the s = 0 pole contribution to Gm,n
p,q . Putting
Eq. (21) into the form of Eq. (22) and applying Cauchy’s
integral formula [35, 36] reveals

variance

T 2
G

in Eq. (13) with

T 2

in Eq. (23).
It is important to note that

T 2
C

N is equivalent to the
C-tilt variance integral expression derived by Holmes [23].
He assumes that the denominator of Eq. (7) is equal to
one. This assumption is accurate in weak turbulence and
provides a very good approximation for the C-tilt vari-
ance. Here, we include the denominator because we are
also interested in the G-tilt, C-tilt error, where its impact
becomes important.
2.
The denominator
We now proceed to the denominator of Eq. (7), the
evaluation of which follows the same steps as above. We
make the weak turbulence approximation exp [4Bχ (ρ)] ≈
1 + 4Bχ (ρ), which splits the denominator into two inte-
grals:

Focusing on σ2

Asymptotic expressions for the C-tilt variance
Although we have obtained a closed-form answer for
the C-tilt variance, the result provides little insight into
how

T 2
C

behaves versus NF .
Inspection of the inte-
grands in Eqs. (21) and (25) reveals that the integrals
converge for all values of NF when the contours are closed
to the left. In both cases, the contours circumscribe the
poles at s = 0, −m + 5/12, −m −1/12, and −m −1 for
m = 0, 1, · · · .
For NF ≪1 (i.e., the far-zone) the numerator of

T 2
C

is well approximated by summing the pole residues at s =
0, 5/12, and −1/12. Performing the requisite analysis

Nevertheless, dividing Eq. (28) by Eq. (29) yields a poor

for NF ≪1.
For NF ≫1 (i.e., the near-zone) the sums over the
pole residues are slow to converge and can result in nu-
merical errors when evaluating the Meijer G-functions in
Eqs. (23) and (26). We, therefore, seek asymptotic so-
lutions to the integrals in Eqs. (21) and (25) that are
accurate in the limit NF →∞. We obtain such solutions
by including contributions from poles to the right of the
contours.
In Eq. (21), the dominant contribution comes from the
pole at s = 5/6 and, in fact, provides an excellent approx-
imation for

T 2

G-tilt, C-tilt error
The G-tilt, C-tilt error EGC is a measure of the G-
tilt, C-tilt anisoplanatism [23, 26], which is an important
metric for adaptive-optics system performance [37–39].
We deﬁne this error as the root-mean-square diﬀerence
between the G-tilt and C-tilt angles, such that
EGC =
rD
|TG −TC|2E
.
(32)
It is easy to show using Eq. (4) that EGC is equivalent
to
EGC =
q
⟨T 2
C⟩−⟨T 2
G⟩.
(33)
Note that the G-tilt angle TG equals Eq. (4) with
exp [2χ (ρ)] = 1.
Substituting Eq. (27) into Eq. (33)
and simplifying yields
EGC =
s
⟨T 2
GC⟩−σ2
χA ⟨T 2
G⟩
1 + σ2
χA
.
(34)
Deriving approximate relations for the G-tilt, C-tilt er-
ror using the asymptotic expressions above is somewhat
ad hoc because the value of the numerator is approxi-
mately zero. Nevertheless, we can obtain relatively accu-
rate relations for EGC.
Staring with NF ≪1, substituting the relevant parts
of Eqs. (28) and (29) into the numerator and keeping
only the ﬁrst two terms yields
EGC ≈1.4017N 5/12

Eq. (35).
For NF

Eqs. (30) and (31) into the numerator of Eq. (34) and
keep only the N −5/6

term. After simpliﬁcation, the re-

SIMULATIONS
To validate the above theory, we employed wave-optics
simulations. In practice, we simulated the propagation

of a λ = 1 µm point source z = 10 km through atmo-
spheric turbulence. Fried’s parameter r0 [40] and σ2
χ were
9.04 cm and 0.2, respectively. We changed the pupil di-
ameter D to vary the Fresnel number NF from 0.5 to 50
in 9 logarithmically spaced steps.
We used the split-step method [41] to simulate wave
propagation for each NF . To avoid aliasing, the simu-
lated ﬁelds required grids that were 850 points on a side.
The grid spacings and number of partial propagations
depended on NF and are given in Table I.
We determined the strengths or r0’s of the phase
screens using the linear optimization method described
in Ref. [41]. The number of phase screens used in a par-
ticular NF simulation was equal to the number of partial
propagations given in Table I. We generated each screen
using the Fourier/spectral method augmented with sub-
harmonics to account for low-spatial-frequency aberra-
tions, especially tilt [42–45]. We used the modiﬁed von
K´arm´an [6, 7] index of refraction power spectrum to
synthesize the phase screens, where the inner and outer
scales were unphysically small and large (l0 = λ/2 and
L0 = 500 km), respectively. The purpose of this was to
closely approximate the Kolmogorov spectrum, which we
used to derive the theoretical expressions in Section II.
After collimating the ﬁeld U in the pupil plane, we win-
dowed U using a circle function with a diameter D equal
to that of the corresponding NF. Then, we computed
both the G-tilt and C-tilt using Lukin’s expression [9]

(37)
In Eq. (37), we computed the gradients using fast Fourier
transforms and evaluated the integrals over the pupil area
A using Simpson’s rule. We computed the C-tilt by di-
rectly applying Eq. (37). For the G-tilt, we extracted the
7
complex argument of U, “ﬂattened” its amplitude, and
then applied Eq. (37).
We computed both the G-tilt and C-tilt statistics from
10, 000 independent turbulence realizations (trials) at
each NF . We then divided the 10, 000 trials into par-
titions of 500, computed the G-tilt and C-tilt variances
over each partition, and averaged the variances. We also
computed the standard deviation of the 20 G-tilt and C-
tilt variances to show the ±1σ bounds on those results.
IV.
RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the results. In the top plot, we dis-
play the C-tilt standard deviation (also known as the
noise-equivalent angle [26]) normalized by the diﬀraction-
limited angular beam width λ/D.
The “Meijer G,”
“NF ≫1,” and “NF ≪1” traces are theoretical predic-
tions using Eqs. (27) [in combination with Eqs. (13), (23),
and (26)], Eqs. (30) and (31), and Eqs. (28) and (29), re-
spectively. We have also included the normalized G-tilt
angle standard deviation as the black dotted curve [see
Eq. (13)]. Lastly, the red circles and black squares, both
with error bars, are the C-tilt and G-tilt simulation re-
sults.
The bottom plot shows the normalized G-tilt, C-tilt er-
ror versus NF . The “Meijer G,” “NF ≫1,” and “NF ≪
1” traces are theoretical predictions using Eq. (34) [again,
in combination with Eqs. (13), (23), and (26)], Eq. (36),
and Eq. (35). The red circles with error bars are the sim-
ulated results computed using the raw G-tilt and C-tilt
angles and Eq. (32).
Overall, the agreement between the simulated and the-
oretical results is quite good. We can explain the minor
diﬀerences between the curves by a combination of the
approximations used to derive the theoretical expressions
and the well-documented diﬃculty in properly including
low-spatial-frequency aberrations in atmospheric turbu-
lence simulations [42, 44, 45].
Before concluding the paper, we would like to point
out that while both the normalized and unnormalized
G-tilt, C-tilt error approach zero as NF →0, the near-
zone limits of the two EGC are diﬀerent. As NF →∞,
the unnormalized EGC, like its corresponding far-zone
expression, approaches zero. However, in the normalized
case, the 1/NF decrease of EGC is exactly canceled by
the 1/NF decrease of λ/D yielding the asymptotic value

In physical units (radians), the EGC initially increases

decreases toward zero for NF > 1.

CONCLUSION
In this paper, we derived three closed-form expressions
for the spherical-wave C-tilt variance

T 2
C

in constant-
C2
n Kolomogorov atmospheric turbulence. All three ex-
pressions were functions of the Fresnel number NF . The
ﬁrst was applicable for all NF and was in the form of a
Meijer G-function. The second and third were much sim-
pler relations and valid in the asymptotic limits NF →0
and NF →∞(i.e., the far- and near-zones, respectively).
In addition, we investigated the diﬀerence between G-tilt
and C-tilt and derived corresponding relations for the G-
tilt, C-tilt error EGC due to a scintillated spherical wave.
Lastly, we validated our analysis by comparing the theory
with wave-optics simulations. Our

T 2
C

and EGC pre-
dictions were in very good agreement with the simulation
results.
The rigorous analysis of C-tilt presented in this paper
will ﬁnd use in quantifying the performance of centroid-
based trackers and wavefront sensors, which are critical
8
components in adaptive-optics systems.
