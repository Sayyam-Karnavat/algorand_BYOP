Title: Can On Body Sensing Be Spatial Adaptive?
Abstract: Wearable sensors are typically affixed to specific locations on the human
body, and their position remains static, only changing unintentionally due to
motion artifacts. This static configuration introduces significant limitations.
As a result, current systems miss the opportunity to capture dynamic
physiological data from diverse body regions. This research investigates the
potential of developing movable sensors that adaptively reposition themselves
to sample different areas of interest on the body, addressing gaps in spatial
coverage. We designed, developed, and fabricated a 3 x 3 matrix platform to
support moving sensors from one location to another. We validated the
feasibility through simulations on a matrix of up to 9 x 9 locations with up to
16 concurrent sensors and real-world prototype characterization.

ABSTRACT
Wearable sensors are typically affixed to specific locations
on the human body, and their position remains static, only
changing unintentionally due to motion artifacts. This static
configuration introduces significant limitations. As a result,
current systems miss the opportunity to capture dynamic
physiological data from diverse body regions. This research
investigates the potential of developing movable sensors that
adaptively reposition themselves to sample different areas of
interest on the body, addressing gaps in spatial coverage. We
designed, developed, and fabricated a 3 √ó 3 matrix platform
to support moving sensors from one location to another. We
validated the feasibility through simulations on a matrix of
up to 9 √ó 9 locations with up to 16 concurrent sensors and
real-world prototype characterization.

INTRODUCTION
Wearables enable various on-body sensing for physical and
physiological measurements, which are essential for various
human-centric sensing purposes such as heartbeat monitor-
ing [3], muscle condition monitoring [13], and brain wave
monitoring [15] for multiple healthcare applications ranging
from detecting cardiovascular anomalies, sensing athletic
performance, to in-depth sleep research and neurological
assessments, just to name a few. Since these signals are often
weak and prone to motion artifacts or environmental noise,
the position of sensors on the body plays a critical role in

preserving signal quality [3], which directly influences the
system‚Äôs accuracy. In addition, human physical and physi-
ological differences often result in different optimal sensor
placements for different people. A one-size-fits-all approach
to sensor placement will not be efficient.
Prior work for these wearable systems mostly relies on
manual adjustment from expert [3] or the sensor matrix de-
ployment to cover a larger area [15] to ensure the quality of
sensing data acquired. These methods suffer from scalabil-
ity issues because manual intervention requires expensive
skilled labor, and sensor matrix methods require multiple
sensors. Figure 1 depicts our envisioned solution for these
systems, where the wearable sensors are moveable to achieve
efficient and effective information acquisition tasks.
Existing sensing approaches for sensor mobility can be
clustered into three categories based on their mobility-medium
relationship, including in-medium (e.g., aerial drones flying
in the air) [2, 10, 14], on-medium (e.g., ground vehicle mov-
ing on the floor) [1, 16], and along-medium movements (e.g.,
rail camera running on the track) [7, 11], as shown in Fig-
ure 1(d). However, these approaches do not directly apply to
wearables due to the following reasons. In-medium devices,

such as drones, require more power to move themselves
around. On-medium devices, such as ground vehicles, are
constrained by gravity and cannot adapt to wearables with
varying body surface orientations. Along-medium devices,
such as rail cameras, have their movement constrained by
the rail and do not support flexible moving directions.
To fill the gap, this research explores a solution suitable
for wearable systems and enabling spatial adaptation. In this
paper, we propose a surface structure-assistive solution that
enables sensors to move on the surface with varying orienta-
tions. We design and implement a surface structure-assistive
prototype with gear structures and a variant of a pathfinding
algorithm that is adapted to the gear structural constraints.
We conduct both simulation and real-world experiments to
validate the feasibility of the design.
We make the following technical contributions in this pa-
per: (1) we developed a spatially adaptive platform enabling
sensors to be mobile on the human body; (2) we designed a
gear-based surface structure to assist in implementing this
mobility; (3) we validated the concept through simulations
on a matrix of up to 9 √ó 9 locations with up to 16 concurrent
sensors; and (4) we confirm the feasibility of the technique
with a real-world prototype and report the results.

PROPOSED APPROACH
To explore the feasibility of spatial adaptation for wearables,
we present a framework that moves sensors along surfaces
with surface-assistive structures. In this section, we first
introduce the surface assistive design choices (Section 2.1).
Then, we present GearUp , a scalable gear-based assistive
surface design to allow sensors to be moved from one to the
desired location (Section 2.2). Finally, we depict a variant
of path planning algorithms accommodating the assistive
structure‚Äôs constraints on the sensor placement and moving
path (Section 2.3).
2.1
Spatial Adaptive Wearable via Surface
Structure-Assistive Sensor Movement
The aforementioned mobility platforms in Figure 2, which
perform in/on/along medium movement, are not directly
applicable in on-body sensor scenarios. For instance, in-
medium platforms like drones offer a high degree of free-
dom but require significant energy[2], resulting in short
battery life, which is impractical for wearable applications.
On-medium platforms, such as autonomous ground robots,
are restricted by gravity from moving in limited orienta-
tions. Unlike in-medium and on-medium solutions, where
the medium is not part of the system, along-medium plat-
forms, like rail cameras, can navigate different rail orienta-
tions but are confined to 1-D predefined paths, limiting the
freedom of movement. Considering the wearable sensors
will be worn, i.e., in contact with the body, we envision their
movement to be along the surface of the body. To allow flexi-
ble spatial adaptation on the body surface, we consider com-
bining on-medium and along-medium designs. Since
the constraint for the along-medium design is the degree of
freedom in movement, we propose moving the medium
and sensor together with a structure-assistive design. To
achieve that, we must consider two aspects of the moveable
sensor design: (1) the mechanism to move and mount on the
surface (Section 2.2) and (2) the moving path (Section 2.3).
2.2
GearUp : Surface Structure-Assistive
Design with Gears
We consider gears the assistive structure for two reasons: (1)
efficient power and motion transmission and (2) fine-grained
directional control. Figure 3 depicts GearUp , a gear-based
platform for surface sensor spatial adaptation.
2.2.1
Mounting Mechanism. Since gear allows fine-grained
directional control, we design the sensor mounting mecha-
nism based on this. Figure 3 (a) shows the design for individ-
ual gear structures with ùê∂channels evenly distributed across
the surface. Each channel has a rail structure marked in yel-
low lines, where sensors will move along it, as shown on
the channel ùëñ. Each gear can hold up to ùê∂number of sensors
simultaneously.
2.2.2
Along Rail Sensor Transfer Mechanism. Sensors move
between two gears via the rail structure on gears. One sensor
is mounted on one channel of one gear at a time. When it
needs to be moved from one gear to the next, this mounting
condition changes. As shown in Figure 3 (b), when two chan-
nels on the gears are connected/aligned, the sensor can move
from one gear to another. Figure 4 shows one prototype of
this mechanism implemented with a servo motor connected
to a small gear pinion in the rack and pinion mechanism

[9]. When the servo motor rotates, the circular motion con-
verts into linear lateral motion, which moves the sensor-rail
connector along the rail.
2.2.3
Gear Matrix Motion Transfer. With the power and
motion transfer ability between gears, only one gear needs
to be connected to the actuator (motor) to rotate all the
interconnected gears. Here, we consider a gear matrix of size
ùëÄ√óùëÅcovering an area of approximately (2ùëü√óùëÄ)√ó(2ùëü√óùëÅ),
where ùëüis the radius of the gear, as shown in Figure 3 (c). The
sensors connected to the gear can move in a circular path
along the motion of the gear. When rotating, two adjacent
gears always rotate in opposite directions. The path planning
on the gear matrix will be introduced in Section 2.3.
2.3
Surface Structure-Constrained Path
Planning
The gear matrix design enables 2D movement transferring
sensors between gears, but it also introduces constraints on
sensor capacity and movements.
2.3.1
Gear Channel Parity. As shown in Figure 4(b), gears
align at certain angles, allowing sensors to move simulta-
neously along connected channels. When two channels are
connected, only one sensor can occupy both channels at
a time. The pattern of these connected channels at differ-
ent gear angles is referred to as Gear Channel Parity. Thus,
GearUp uses this parity phenomenon to coordinate multi-
ple sensor movements with one gear rotation step without
affecting certain sensor positions.
2.3.2
Sensor Capacity. In a ùëõ√óùëõgear matrix, the maximum
number of sensors that can move to any target location is

and ùëî[0][2] can be transferred to each other‚Äôs positions. Sim-
ilarly, ùëî[0][2] and ùëî[2][2] can be transferred to each other‚Äôs
positions. The transposed submatrix 3 √ó 2 can also transfer
sensors of positions ùëî[0][0] and ùëî[2][0].

Proof. For any ùëõ√ó ùëõ, ‚àÄùëõ‚ààN+, ùëõ‚â•2 gear matrix, let
there be a set of sensor location states ùê∫ùëõ, such that each
element in ùê∫ùëõis a matrix containing

sensors attached to alternating gears on the matrix. It is
required to prove that for any matrix in ùê∫ùëõ, there is a valid
swap to any other matrix in ùê∫ùëõ.
Suppose we have a set of gear matrices ùê∫ùëõwith size ùëõ‚àà
N+, ùëõ‚â•2, such that each gear matrix has a possible path
to any other gear matrix in ùê∫ùëõ. We wish to prove that the
successor, ùê∫ùëõ+1, is a set in which all elements have a possible
path to any other element in ùê∫ùëõ+1.
Suppose we model each element in ùê∫ùëõ+1 as some matrix
where ‚àÄùëîùëõ+1 ‚ààùê∫ùëõ+1, submatrices in ùê∫2 swap to other sub-
matrices in ùê∫2 1, until ‚àÉùëîùëõ‚ààùê∫ùëõ| ùëîùëõ+1[0 : ùëõ][0 : ùëõ] = ùëîùëõ:

Ô£πÔ£∫Ô£∫Ô£∫Ô£∫Ô£∫Ô£∫Ô£∫Ô£∫Ô£ª
Since any ùëîùëõcan swap to another, any submatrix of size
ùëõ√ó ùëõin the larger gear matrix ùëîùëõ+1 can swap with any other
submatrix containing the same elements at the same position.
For the ordered sequence of sensors ùë†: ‚àÄùë†‚àâùëîùëõ, any two
neighbors can be transferred in-place with proof ‚ÄúIn-Place
Transfer‚Äù. Therefore, the sequence can be rearranged in any
order with in-place swapping only. In this way, any ùëîùëõ+1 is
able to swap with any other ùëîùëõ+1 in the set ùê∫ùëõ+1.
Therefore, ùê∫is a set such that ùê∫2 ‚ààùê∫and ùê∫contains all
its successors. Therefore, G is a set of all ùê∫ùëõ‚ààùê∫| ùëõ‚ààN+,
ùëõ‚â•2, where each element contains all combinations of
sensor locations in a checkerboard pattern, such that there is
a possible swapping sequence to any combination of sensor
locations in a checkerboard pattern in the same gear matrix
size.

2.3.3
Path Planning with Parity Constraints. GearUp uses
a traditional path planning algorithm ranking each path by
its Manhattan distance between the current and target sen-
sor locations. In order for this algorithm to work with the
Gear Channel Parity, we incorporate collision filtering to
remove any path that moves two sensors to the same con-
nected channel. The unique Gear Channel Parity property
also allows multiple sensors to move concurrently after each

gear rotation in one simulation step, so we designed the path
planning to consider all possible combinations of parallel
sensor movement to decrease path steps toward the target
location. For each unique gear rotation, a certain pattern of
pair channels is connected, so we designed a dynamic mask-
ing technique that records which connections are available
for which gear angles. This masked connection matrix is
matched with sensors according to their location to update
all possible paths.

PRELIMINARY EVALUATION
In this section, we demonstrate the feasibility and scalability
of the proposed approach through a real-world prototype
implementation and characterization. The correctness of the
constrained path planning concept is validated via scale and
population analysis with simulation.
3.1
Prototype Characterization
The prototype‚Äôs movements per step consist of two actions:
rotating the gear and transferring the sensor between adja-
cent gears. We characterize the time for these two actions
by repeating the action 10 times. The rotating gear for 90¬∞

takes 0.38 (¬±0.025) seconds. The sensor movement across
connected channels takes 0.56 (¬±0.023) seconds.
3.2
Gear Matrix Size Analysis
The first evaluation is GearUp ‚Äôs ability to navigate the sensor
to the desired locations over different sizes of gear matrices.
We conduct an experiment where we simulated a gear matrix
of size ùëõ√ó ùëõ, with the value of ùëõranging from 3-9. We ran-
domly select the start and end locations for four sensors and
start their path simultaneously. We analyze the total steps
for all four sensors to reach their end location. This experi-
ment is repeated 128 times, and the average steps for each
matrix size are reported in Figure 6. We observe a general
linear increasing trend in the required number of steps as the
matrix size increases, which indicates the effectiveness of the
pathfinding algorithm, which finds near-optimal solutions
close to the Manhattan distance.
3.3
Sensor Population Analysis
The sensor population is another factor that impacts the
path-finding capabilities of GearUp framework. To evaluate
this, we simulate a gear matrix of 4 √ó 4 with 4 channels
per gear. The number of sensors changed from 1 to 16, the
system randomly selected the start and end locations, and
the path planning module outputs the steps required to reach
the end location. The process is repeated 128 times for each
sensor number (1-16), and the average steps required for all
the sensors to reach the end location is reported.
Figure 7 shows the output results of the average steps
required by the sensors to reach the target location on 4
matrix as the number of sensors changes. We observe a
general increasing trend in the number of steps required
as the number of sensors increases. This is because as the
number of sensors increases, the total available channel space
on different gears decreases, resulting in sensors taking a
longer path. We also observe that the standard deviation
among required steps increases as the number of sensors
increases.

NEXT STEPS
Although the preliminary results are encouraging, multiple
research questions remain unanswered, leaving space for
future research activities.
Pathfinding Optimization. In this work, we implement a
greedy path-finding algorithm for a multi-agent path-planning
scenario, which is not ideal. Some cases exist in which the
current system can run into a bottleneck state. In the future,
we want to optimize this to minimize the required steps.
Building upon rich literature on multi-agent path planning
in the field of robotics [4, 17], we will explore the surface
structural constraint-based algorithm adaptation.
Uneven Surface Sensor Movement. The current gear matrix-
based prototype is implemented on a flat surface for feasibil-
ity verification. We envision this design to be implemented
on flexible, uneven surfaces that people wear. Potential chal-
lenges include rotation with soft, uneven gear structure and
on-gear rail alignment. One possible direction to explore is
having the flexible gears sandwiched between two flexible
layers, which would allow them to adapt to the curvature
while preventing direct contact of sensor movement with
the user‚Äôs body.
Hardware Miniaturization. The current prototype of the
GearUp system uses market-available servo motors for gear
matrix movement and sensor movement across different
gears, this makes system size dependent on the size of servo
motors. This prevents the current system from being directly
applied to the wearable systems. In the future, we plan to ex-
plore the potential solutions to miniaturize the servo motors
along with the size of the whole system, so that it can be
directly applied to the wearable systems. To achieve this we
need to rethink the manufacturing of different components.
The current prototype uses 3D printing or later cut com-
ponents which can be replaced with moulding to improve
precision.

RELATED WORK
Besides the related work mentioned above, this section sum-
marizes other notable parallel research efforts in mobile sen-
sors and describes their limitations.
Existing Sensing Mobility Platforms. Multiple robotics sens-
ing platforms are explored to increase the adaptability and
sensing area of a system effectively. Autonomous ground
robots are used for various agricultural sensing tasks [1, 16].
While on-water robots have been explored for applications
such as water quality monitoring [8]. Unmanned Aerial Ve-
hicles (UAVs) have been explored for numerous applications
such as remote delivery, surveillance, and warfare appli-
cations [2, 10]. Similarly, Unmanned Underwater Vehicles
(UUVs) are also explored for applications such as sea ex-
ploration and rescue missions [14]. Various on-rail mobile
platforms are also explored for applications such as railway
maintenance, pipe surveillance, and navigation [7, 11]. As
previously discussed, these mobile platforms are not directly
applicable to wearable sensing systems.
Adaptive Design for Wearables. Prior work has explored
various aspects of wearable system adaptation. Soft and struc-
tured conformative designs assist the wearable systems to
better adapt to bodies of different physiology differences
[5, 12]. They morph into the user‚Äôs body shape physically to
enable more comfortable fitting but cannot provide sensor
mobility. The other work in wearable systems explores the
use of body robots to assist humans in rehabilitation move-
ment [6] based on adapting to the force generated by the
user; the system uses the load cell to adjust the actuation
proportional to the human-generated force. However, this
system adapts according to force generation but lacks the
sensor movement for accurate force reading across subjects.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we propose a surface structure assistive frame-
work to enable mobility for wearable systems on arbitrary
surfaces. We present GearUp , a gear-based surface augmenta-
tion solution to enable concurrent 2D movement on surfaces
for multiple sensors. We implement the physical prototype
and show the feasibility of the hardware with preliminary
characterization. We also analyze the system performance
via simulation for a matrix of up to 9 √ó 9 locations with up
to 16 concurrent sensors.
